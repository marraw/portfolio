# Portfolio

My portfolio website build with Angular CLI (version 11.0.2). It's created in order to show more details about me, contact methods and group together rest of my projects. Thank you for visiting!

## Layout

Whole layout is designed by me with the exception of animated sphere made by [wontem](https://codepen.io/wontem).
Writing it from scratch and taking care of RWD was a nice challenge that helped me to understand UI and UX much better.

## Server

Website is deployed by me on Ubuntu server using NGINX, UFW and PM2.
The whole thing is server side rendered with Angular Universal.
