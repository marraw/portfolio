# Portfolio

My portfolio website build with Angular CLI (version 11.0.2). I created it in order to show more details about me, contact methods and group together rest of my projects. Thank you for visiting!

## Contact form

For contact form I'm using [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) backend service. It's convenient and reliable, such a perfect match for a frontend developer.

## Server

Website is deployed by me on Ubuntu server using NGINX, UFW and PM2. I'm using my own domain provided by [nazwa.pl](https://nazwa.pl/).

## Build

My portfolio is build with Angular Universal (SSR) which improves SEO a lot.

## Accessibility

I'm always thinking about making my website accessible for users that are limited to keyboard or even NonVisual Desktop Access. To make sure that everything's fine I tested it with NVDA by myself.

## Layout

Layout is designed by me with the exception of animated sphere made by [wontem](https://codepen.io/wontem).
Writing it from scratch and taking care of RWD was a nice challenge that helped me to understand UI and UX much better.

## Devicon

All of svg icons in the 'skills' section come from [Devicon v2](https://github.com/devicons/devicon).

## Favicon

Favicon created by [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/).
