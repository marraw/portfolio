# Portfolio

My portfolio website created with Angular CLI (version 11.0.2). This website is to show more details about me, contact methods and group together rest of my projects.

## Layout

Whole layout is designed by me with the exception of animated sphere made by [wontem](https://codepen.io/wontem).
Writing it from scratch and taking care of RWD was a nice challenge that helped to understand UI and UX at least at a beginner level.

## Server

Website is deployed by me on Ubuntu server using NGINX, UFW and PM2.
The whole thing is server side rendered with Angular Universal.
